## Useless App for Processing/Java

**An experiment in existential programming

This app uses Java's robot class to hijack your mouse and close the application controlling it. 

There is a built-in safety switch to auto-exit after 10s. 

OpenCV for Processing is based on the officially supported [OpenCV Java API](http://docs.opencv.org/java/), currently at version 2.4.5. In addition to using the wrapped functionality, you can import OpenCV modules and use any of its documented functions: [OpenCV javadocs](http://docs.opencv.org/java/). See the advanced examples (HistogramSkinDetection, DepthFromStereo, and Marker Detection) below for details. (This style of API was inspired by Kyle McDonald's [ofxCv addon](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) for OpenFrameworks.)
